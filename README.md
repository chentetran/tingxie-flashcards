A program that simulates flashcards to help study for 听写s.
Prompts user with pinyin and expects the user to input the correct character.
To practice writing the characters, use the trackpad chinese handwriting recognizer to input characters.

Reads pinyin and hanzi from a .txt file.
Format should be the prompt, followed by '|', followed by the correct answer.

Example:
nǐhǎo|你好
wǒ|我
diànnǎo|电脑

Doesn't necesarily have to be for tingxies specifically.
